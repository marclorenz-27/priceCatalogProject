		Make a page that indexes the products from the database and displays it into a table.
			Include the average appraisal amount using the following query:
				$query = "SELECT AVG(appraised_amount) FROM products WHERE product_name = 'Galaxy S10+';";
				Use the LIKE operator to calculate the average appraisal amount of the similar items but saved with different product names.
			The search function for the products with the use of AJAX. Also inform the user that there is no result from the search.
			Pagination for the products.
		Make a page that displays the product individually (for view more details).
		Make a page that creates new products.
		Make a page that updates the products.
