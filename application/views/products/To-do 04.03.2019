To-Do
Recreate Product_model
	-	utilize the use of one function to index both 'all' and 'invidual' products
	-	use get_where() function with JOIN to get indexes with the use of foreign keys. [test] (to keep the use of only one function)
	-	utilize the SOLID principles of coding for Object Oriented Programming
	-	
	Single responsibility principle
		A class should have only a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
	Openâ€“closed principle
		"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
	Liskov substitution principle
		"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
	Interface segregation principle
		"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
	Dependency inversion principle
		One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
